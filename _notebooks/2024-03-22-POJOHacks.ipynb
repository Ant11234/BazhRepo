    "Situation: You are developing a system to manage a small personal library. Each book in the library is represented by a POJO called **Book** .\n",

    "(b) Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a class **Library** that maintains a collection of **Book** objects. The Book class has already been defined with the following private instance variables: **title** (a **String** representing the title of the book), **author** (a **String** representing the author of the book), and **yearPublished** (an **int** representing the year the book was published). The class has the corresponding getters for these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the POJO class **Book** including a no-argument constructor, a constructor with parameters to initialize all the fields, getters for all the instance variables, and a **toString()** method that returns a String in the format \"Title by Author (Year)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Library class with the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **addBook(Book newBook)**: A method that takes a Book object and adds it to the library's collection.\n",
    "- **getOldestBook()**: This method returns the Book that was published the earliest in the collection.\n",
    "- **toString()**: This method returns a String with all books' details in the library, each separated by a newline character."

    "# A Comprehensive Review of all the Basics of Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I feel much more confident with Java, and have a better understanding of the language all together when compared to trimester 1, their are gaps in my knowledge when it comes to the language. The purpose of this jupyter notebook is to use all the resources provided by Mr. Mortsen in the teacher portfolio pertrayning to the basics of Java in order to fill the gaps in my knowledge and create a stronger foundation for my more advanced projects like the American Sign Language AI, and any others in my future.\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "- Java is an Object-Oriented Programming Language\n",
    "    * Object Oriented Programming is an approach to creating and using models of physical or imagined objects\n",
    "- In order to create models of objects, we use classes\n",
    "    * A class is a programmer-defined \"blueprint\" where objects are created\n",
    "- Writing a class:\n",
    "    * First create a java file with the same name as what we will use for the class\n",
    "    * Name should start with a camptal letter\n",
    "    * If there are multiple words in a name, the most widely accepted method of differentiating between words is by using Camel Case, a naming convention where the first letter of every word is capatalized in order to clearly show what the name is meant to be\n",
    "        - Ex: PredictionService.java\n",
    "    * Classes are started by first writing public class followed by the name of the file and two curly brackets \"{}\"\n",
    "    * Majority of our classes are public because we want other files to be able to access the variables and functions created within the class.\n",
    "        - One example of a public class that I've created is PredictionService below:"
